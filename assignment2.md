## ASSIGNMENT 2: Packaging a Python project for Bioconda using Grayskull

In this second assignment we will work on automatically generating a conda recipe from a PyPI package, using Grayskull.
To publish a Bioconda package is neccessary to set a GitHub repository and a conda recipe, the latter outlines the steps needed to build a package from source code.

Objectives of this aasignment

✔️ Familiarize with conda recipes.
✔️ Use Grayskull to generate a Bioconda recipe.
✔️ Build and test the package locally.
✔️ Be aware that submission to Bioconda requires further preparation. 

### Step 1

We will use an existing Python project from GitHub, ideally the repository and the pypi package was set up on the first assignment of the workshop, if successfully completed.

### Step 2
Install [Grayskull](https://github.com/conda/grayskull)



```python
pip install grayskull
```

### Step 3

Run Gray skull to automatically generate a conda recipe from a python package.


```python
grayskull pypi new_project
```


```python
grayskull pypi package_publishing_example 
```

#### Recipe generated on /home/patin005/workshop/package_publishing_example for package_publishing_example ###

This command will create a new folder called 'new_project'. Inside, you will find the meta.yaml file, containing the metadata neccessary to create a conda package.


```python
new_project/
├── meta.yaml #Main recipe file, contains the build, test information
```

### Step 4

After automatically generating the conda recipe you can edit the meta.yaml file. If you did not use Grayskull, you will need to manually write the script. 

For the example Pypi package named "package_publishing_example", the following meta.yaml is generated by Grayskull:


```python
{% set name = "package_publishing_example" %}
{% set version = "0.0.4" %}

package:
  name: {{ name|lower }}
  version: {{ version }}

source:
  url: https://pypi.org/packages/source/{{ name[0] }}/{{ name }}/package_publishing_example-{{ version }}.tar.gz
  sha256: dd5ffdb8db6e6f2ba05546f230abc53ee897497d4eb81a1808fbe6290a07bf6f

  entry_points:
    - ppe = package_publishing_example.cli:cli
  noarch: python
  script: {{ PYTHON }} -m pip install . -vv --no-deps --no-build-isolation

    - typer >=0.15.2
    - uv-dynamic-versioning >=0.6.0

test:
  imports:
    - package_publishing_example
  commands:
    - pip check
    - ppe --help
  requires:
    - pip

```



### Step 5

When building a Bioconda package, conda-build reads the metadata or the conda recipe and creates a conda package containing all the files in the build environment and the specified build dependencies. If recipe includes tests it also tests the new conda package. 


```python
conda install -y conda-build
```

### Step 6
We will now build the package locally, for this we will use conda build, , run this command from the root folder (of your username). [Conda build](https://conda.org/blog/2023-05-18-how-to-use-conda-build/)



```python
conda build new_project
```

If build was successful, Conda will generate a package file in the conda-bld directory. To locate this file, you can use this command from the terminal:


```python
conda build new_project --output
```

???? THIS STEP IS NOT WORKING
```
Could not solve for environment specs
The following package could not be installed
└─ uv-dynamic-versioning =* * does not exist (perhaps a typo or a missing channel).
```

### Step 7

Once the package has been built, you can test it. Create a conda environmet and install your built package.


```python
conda create -n test_environment
conda activate test_env
conda install --use-local new_project
conda activate test_environment
new_project --help
```

If it was successfully built and tested, the package is ready for submission to Bioconda. Importantly, the packages that are published in Bioconda are strictly reviewed before is accepted.

### Step 7 (Do not run it in this workshop)

Finally, once you have build a conda package ideally you will submit a request to pubish your package. This step cannot be performed for the example python package created in this workshop, however is still explained with the purpose of showing the publishing process.

To upload your package to [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/):


```python
anaconda upload /path/to/my_package-1.0-0.tar.bz2
```

Using Grayskull and conda-build to create and manage a pypi package simplifies and automatizes the process of distribution and installation.
